    <h2>A Review of HTML</h2>
    <p>
      HTML is really a very simple scripting language. It consists of ordinary
      text, with elements that are enclosed by "<" and ">" characters. <br />
      The best part about HTML is that once we know how to efficiently use basic
      elements, we can look up how to use all of the others!

  <h3><u>Headings</u></h3>
  <h1>This is a size "1" heading</h1>
  <h2>This is a size "2" heading</h2>
  <h3>This is a size "3" heading</h3>
  <h4>This is a size "4" heading</h4>
  <h5>This is a size "5" heading</h5>
  <h6>This is a size "6" heading</h6>

  <h3><u>Lists</u></h3>
  <p>
    Below is an example of a nested-list, using both an ordered and an unordered
    list:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>First</li>
    <li>Second</li>
    <li>Third</li>
    <ul>
      <li>3rd Place</li>
      <li>Tres</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Fourth</li>
  </ol>

  <h3><u>Links</u></h3>
  <p>Links are very useful, and help users navigate to new pages, both within and outside of the current website.
    <br> For instance, they can be used to direct users to <a href="https://www.google.com/?safe=active&ssui=on" target="_blank">Google's Homepage</a>.
    <a href="mailto:micmurphy@student.mamkschools.org">Emails<a> can also be easily sent through the use of links.
    <br> <a href="#Title">They can even bring the user to a certain place within a webpage</a>.

  <h3><u>Images</u></h3>

  <p>Sometimes we want to go ahead and align pictures to the left of a line of text. Using the "align" attribute, with a value of "left" is a perfect way to do this. You could also align the picture to the right of text by replacing the value in the "align" attribute to "right".</p>
